Its Buffy the vampire slayer time.
Its really hard sometimes.
And its that they don’t understand them.
Who know's where?
Its more like when we all run down the field with the person who has the ball.
I mean yeah its cute, its transportation so I'm not gonna ram it into a tree.
They think its unfair of me.
Hey, it's curly in the morning but slowly straightens to get wavyish by the time its dry.
But its just that I can never do anything because of him.
And its more like sit there sniffling.
Until its dried a little, we have to use it.
Don't you set down on the steps 'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.
So I confused things a but and it was Kai Ahrens who had planned that.
So I can up with the idea of implementing a new software.
That being sad, he is an idiot.
Could someone give advise on a better way to do this.
I don't how to call in English.
